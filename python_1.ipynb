    "1] Simple and easy to learn: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python is a simple programming language. When we read Python program,we can feel like reading english statements. \n",
    "\n",
    "2. The syntaxes are very simple and only 30+ kerywords are available. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. When compared with other languages, we can write programs with very less number of lines. Hence more readability and simplicity. \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2] Freeware and Open Source: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We can use Python software without any licence and it is freeware. \n",
    "2. Its source code is open\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3] High Level Programming language: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Python is high level programming language and hence it is programmer friendly language. \n",
    "2. Being a programmer we are not required to concentrate low level activities like memory management and security etc. \n",
    " \n",
    "4] Platform Independent: \n",
    "\n",
    "1. Once we write a Python program,it can run on any platform without rewriting once again. \n",
    "2. Internally PVM is responsible to convert into machine understandable form. \n",
    "\n",
    "5] Dynamically Typed:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In Python we are not required to declare type for variables. Whenever we are assigning the value, based on value, type will be allocated automatically.Hence Python is considered as dynamically typed language. \n",
    "2. But Java, C etc are Statically Typed Languages b'z we have to provide type at the beginning only. \n",
    "3. This dynamic typing nature will provide more flexibility to the programmer.\n",
